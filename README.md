## Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm on the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset. The goal is to group customers based on their annual income and spending score, helping businesses understand customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset
- Dataset Name: Mall Customer Segmentation Data
- Source: [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- File: `data/Mall_Customers.csv`

## Project Structure
Mall-Customer-Segmentation/
~ data(folder) -- Mall_customers.csv
~ mall_customer_segmentation.ipynb
~ README.md
~ requirements.txt



## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Feature selection: Annual Income and Spending Score
- Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Applying K-Means clustering algorithm
- Visualizing customer segments using scatter plots

## Output
- Elbow Plot: helps decide the optimal number of clusters
- Customer Segments Plot: visualizes clusters in terms of income vs spending
